//
// **Until this existed, the chat could not answer at all.** `@theia/ai-chat`
// registers no user-facing agent -- Theia's `Universal` and `Coder` live in
// `@theia/ai-ide`, which this application deliberately does not install (it
// drags `puppeteer-core` and the AI terminal surface ADR-0011 withdrew). Nothing
// else bound a `ChatAgent`, so every request reached `ChatService` and came back
// as "No agent was found to handle this request".
//
// That is also why `gearbox_toggle_gear` had never run: a tool is offered to the
// model only if an agent names it in `functions`, and there was no agent to name
// it.
//
// **`AbstractStreamParsingChatAgent` rather than a text-parsing base**, because
// the answers here are prose with tool calls threaded through them, not a
// structured document to be parsed back out.
