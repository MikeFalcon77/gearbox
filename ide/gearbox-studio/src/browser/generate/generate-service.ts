// A service rather than a handler in the widget: there are four independent
// reasons to refuse a write, and they have to be named in the UI when they
// fail. "Apply is disabled" with no reason is a dead end. Keeping the checks
// here means the next surface that wants to apply a plan does not reimplement
// them.
//
// The four, in the order a person can do something about them:
//
//   1. `capabilities.generate` -- otherwise the view is not offered at all;
//   2. `capabilities.writes` -- the client must have declared the right;
//   3. no resolution errors -- the engine refuses those on the server too;
//   4. no `FileAction::Conflict` -- GBX0701; a partial apply is forbidden.
//
// The plan is fetched lazily, the way the lock is: the other panels never need
// it, and a plan from the previous profile is worse than none.
