// Suppressing a menu entry and a command does not remove a panel that is already
// **in a saved layout**. `Type Hierarchy` and a `zsh` terminal kept coming back at
// the bottom of the shell after the shell stopped offering either -- Theia's
// `ShellLayoutRestorer` faithfully restores what was there before the rules
// changed, which is correct of it and wrong for the reader.
//
// So the rules changing needs a migration, and a migration has to run **once**.
// Closing these on every start would be a different bug: a terminal a person
// deliberately opened would vanish on reload, which is worse than one they did not
// ask for staying. The version below is what makes it once; bump it when the set
// of panels the application has changes again.
//
// Deliberately not `ApplicationShellLayoutMigration`, Theia's own hook for this:
// that one is keyed to the layout *schema* version and exists for rewriting
// serialised layout data. Nothing about the schema changed -- the application's
// inventory did -- so this closes widgets through the shell instead of rewriting
// a blob, which is both smaller and legible in a stack trace.
