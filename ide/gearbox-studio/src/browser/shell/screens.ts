// Which screen belongs to which subject, and for how long.
//
// `StudioContextService` answers *what is being worked on*. This answers the two
// questions that follow from it, and they are not the same question:
//
//   * **availability** -- where a screen may be opened at all;
//   * **lifetime** -- which subject an already-open one belongs to.
//
// Scoping by `context.kind` alone answers only the first, and a UX pass found
// what the gap costs. Stage an Add Gear proposal against one product, open
// another: the kind is still `product`, so nothing is withdrawn, and
// `ProductEditService.commitAddGear` reads `this.product.current.open` at commit
// time -- so the proposal built for the first product is written to the second.
// The empty `Gearbox Product` tab the pass reported is the same defect with a
// visible symptom; this is the same defect without one.
//
// So a screen is scoped to a `ContextIdentity` -- `product:<path>`, not
// `product` -- and the shell withdraws on a change of *subject*, not merely on a
// change of kind.
//
// **Data and pure functions, no injection**, for the reason
// `session-command-ids.ts` is dependency-free: this is read by the view
// contributions, by the scope service and by the claims, and a module that
// imported widgets to name them would close a cycle through every one of them.
// The ids are therefore literals, and a regression claim asserts each one is a
// widget this application actually registers.

 * id from one product's closure -- so a stale one is a real complaint. But it is
 * also the one screen that is *valid with no product*: its co-location view
 * reads the catalogue, and three claims reach it from Home. Withdrawing it on
 * every change of subject therefore destroyed a screen that the new context can
 * hold perfectly well, and destroyed it mid-interaction -- observed as a view
 * switch that silently did not take, because the widget behind the click had
 * been rebuilt and a fresh one starts on co-location.
 *
 * So the widget survives and `GraphWidget` clears what belonged to the previous
 * product. Closing a screen is the right answer when nothing in it means
 * anything any more, which is true of the five product screens above and is not
 * true of this one.
 *
 * **The Inspector is `global`**, and its subject gate is a context key rather
 * than a lifetime: what makes it empty is an absent *selection*, not an absent
 * product, and `QuickViewService.getPicks` filters on `when` alone, so a gate
 * that must reach `Open View...` has to be a key.
