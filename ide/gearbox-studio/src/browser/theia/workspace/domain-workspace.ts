// The workspace is a domain object, not something a person has to find.
//
// ADR 0011 lists this among the mechanisms Arduino IDE uses: "Make the workspace
// root a domain object -- `WorkspaceService.toFileStat` override: open a `.ino`,
// get its sketch folder." The same idea, one step earlier: Studio already knows
// which directories it works on, so it opens them rather than showing an empty
// Explorer and waiting.
//
// Three things stop working without a workspace, and none of them look like a
// missing workspace:
//
//   - the Explorer has nothing to browse, so `gear.gdl` and `product.gdl` can
//     only be reached through a Gearbox link;
//   - a generated `product.lock` cannot be opened at all, which left the
//     read-only-lock requirement implemented and unverifiable;
//   - the VS Code git extension finds repositories by walking workspace folders,
//     so Source Control stays empty however well the plugin host works.
//
// **Multi-root is not a preference here, it is forced by the layout.** The two
// repositories are siblings -- `gearbox` and `gears-rust` -- so no single
// folder contains both, and a single-folder workspace would silently cover only
// half the tree a person edits.
