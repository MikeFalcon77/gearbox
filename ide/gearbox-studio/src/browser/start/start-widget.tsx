// What there is to do when no product is open.
//
// The Home context used to have an empty main area with the catalogue beside it,
// which said "this is an IDE with nothing loaded" rather than "this is a tool for
// building products, and you have not chosen one". STM32CubeMX opens on exactly
// three things -- New, Load, Recent -- and only then shows domain views; this is
// that screen minus the one that is not built.
//
// **Create and clone are here now.** Both go through the same screen: a wizard
// with a live preview on the right (`cpt-gearbox-adr-authoring-ownership-tiers`
// §Consequences: a preview is not optional). Clone reads the source file and
// changes only `id` and `name`; everything else — comments included — survives.
// The two lists are deliberately not merged. `Open Product…` offers one list
// because a picker is a question with one answer; here there is room to say which
// products are *in this workspace* and which were *opened before*, and those are
// different facts about a product.
