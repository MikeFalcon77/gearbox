// The TextMate grammar for `.gdl`.
//
// Hand-written, but not hand-informed: every word list it matches comes from
// `./generated/vocabulary.ts`, which `cargo test -p gearbox-gdl --test
// export_grammar` derives from the globals the interpreter actually evaluates
// against. The split is deliberate -- the volatile part of a grammar is its
// vocabulary, the hard part is its regexes, and only the first can drift.
//
// GDL is a restricted Starlark dialect, so the lexical rules below are
// Starlark's, checked against `starlark_syntax::lexer` rather than assumed from
// Python: escapes are `\xHH` / `\uHHHH` / `\UHHHHHHHH` / octal and *not*
// `\u{...}`, a string is raw exactly when its prefix contains `r`, and f-strings
// do not exist (`enable_f_strings: false`).
//
// One grammar for both `gear.gdl` and `product.gdl`. Splitting on filename
// would need two language ids and would still not cover the `load()` fragments,
// which may be named anything -- and highlighting is not validation. The engine
// already refuses `gear()` inside a product with a better message than a
// missing colour.
