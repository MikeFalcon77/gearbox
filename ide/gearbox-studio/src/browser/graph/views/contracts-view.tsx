// The contract graph: which consumer reaches which provider, and where a process
// boundary can run between them.
//
// A co-location edge is link-time and can never be cut; a contract edge is the
// opposite, and this view is where the difference becomes a picture. Three states,
// and each one is the resolver's verdict rather than this file's opinion:
//
//   * **solid** -- `mode: local`, and the resolver reports no way to sever it.
//     The two gears are in the same binary and the call is a function call.
//   * **dashed** -- `mode: remote`. The resolver *did* cut here: a process
//     boundary runs through this edge and the call crosses it over `transport`.
//   * **red** -- the edge appears in `cuttable_if_declared` with
//     `blocked_by: undeclared-hub-edge`. Note which way that field points:
//     `CutCandidate` is "an edge the resolver would sever, but cannot", so these
//     are forced local *for a reason that is fixable in source*, which is why the
//     plan singles the hub edge out for red. Other blockers are drawn solid with
//     their reason named, because "cannot be cut, and here is why" is a different
//     statement from "should not be cut".
//
// Cut candidates are drawn even when no `ResolvedBinding` exists for the pair.
// An undeclared client lookup produces exactly that shape -- a real runtime edge
// with no declaration behind it -- and leaving it out would hide the one thing
// this view exists to surface (`cpt-gearbox-fr-report-cuttable-if-declared`).
//
// **No `BindingMechanism` literal appears here, and that is a constraint rather
// than a matter of style.** `mechanism` names the code path the runtime takes and
// the resolver derives it from placement; a client that renders one is consuming a
// projected fact, while a client that *branches* on one has taken over a resolver
// decision. So severability is looked up in the engine's own
// `cuttable_if_declared`, never inferred. `prd-studio.spec.ts` enforces this.

 * One drawn arrow per consumer/provider pair.

 * Merged rather than one arrow per contract, because the demo product binds
 * `PaymentApi@v1` and `@v2` between the same two gears, and two arrows between one
 * pair of boxes overlap into an unreadable smear. The label carries both contracts.
 *
 * Merging loses nothing, and the reason is in the IR: `mode` is "derived from
 * placement, never configured". Two gears are either in one process or in two, so
 * every binding between the same pair agrees about `mode` -- there is no case where
 * one contract is local and another remote between the same boxes. `remote` is
 * still folded with `||` rather than taken from the first binding, because relying
 * on that invariant silently would make a future change to placement show up as a
 * wrong picture rather than as a failing test.
