// Studio's own settings, declared the way Theia declares settings.
//
// **Why a schema and not a panel.** The obvious reading of "Studio needs a field
// for the API key" is a widget with an input in it. That would have been a second
// settings surface: one to build, one to style, one to teach, and one that every
// later setting has to be added to by hand. Theia already has a settings editor,
// and it renders whatever a `PreferenceContribution` declares -- so the whole of
// this file is the field, and the next setting is one more entry below.
//
// **Why our own namespace was necessary.** The Anthropic key already exists as
// `ai-features.anthropic.AnthropicApiKey`, and it is unreachable:
// `hide-ai-preferences-contribution.js` stamps `hidden: true` on every key
// starting `ai-features.`, because upstream expects the AI Configuration view --
// which lives in `@theia/ai-ide`, the package ADR-0011 does not install -- to
// replace them. That filter is a literal `startsWith`, so `gearbox.*` is
// untouched and renders normally. `settings/api-key-service.ts` is what carries a
// value from here to there.
//
// **Clear text, said out loud.** A preference is stored in
// `~/.theia/settings.json`. `scope: User` is the part that matters: it makes the
// key unwritable into a workspace or folder `.theia/settings.json`, which are the
// files that get committed. The description says the rest, because a masked input
// hides a value from a shoulder, not from a file.
