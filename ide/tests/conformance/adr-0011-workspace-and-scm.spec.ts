// true before Git could be anything but an empty panel, and neither was:
//
//   - a workspace has to be open, because the VS Code git extension finds
//     repositories by walking workspace folders;
//   - it has to be **multi-root**, because the two repositories that matter are
//     siblings -- `gearbox-builder` and `gears-rust` -- so no single folder
//     contains both.
//
// The second is the reason this is not just "open a folder". A single-folder
// workspace would have covered half the tree a person edits and looked like it
// worked.

 * A file that makes the repository dirty, for as long as the claim needs it.

 * **The two Git claims below used to depend on the developer's working tree.**
 * They asserted "the badge is greater than zero" and "some node carries a letter",
 * which is true whenever someone has uncommitted work and false the moment they
 * commit -- so the suite went red on a clean checkout and green again after any
 * edit. A conformance run that reports the state of somebody's editor is not
 * reporting on the application.
 *
 * So the claim makes its own change: one untracked file, asserted on, then removed.
 * That is also a stronger statement than the old one -- the provider is not merely
 * non-zero, it *noticed something appear* -- and it holds on a clean checkout,
 * which is where a conformance suite has to hold.
 *
 * Outside `products/`, because the three guards on the descriptions exist to catch
