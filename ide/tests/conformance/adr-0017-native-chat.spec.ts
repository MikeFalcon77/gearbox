// **What is browser-observable here, and what deliberately is not.** The claims
// this file asserts are structural: that an agent exists to answer at all, that
// the context the chat is handed follows the selection, and that the rows which
// feed it can be dragged. What a model *says* is asserted nowhere. That needs a
// key and a network, and a second run would not agree with the first -- a
// conformance suite whose result depends on a sampler has reported nothing.
//
// The claims about the tool surface's shape -- every tool returns engine output,
// none applies generation -- are enforced where they are decidable: in the
// TypeScript that declares them, checked by `tsc`, and in the generator tests
// under `crates/gearbox-ir`. Asserting "no tool can write" through a browser
// would mean asking a model to try, which is the sampler problem again.
