// `PerspectiveService.switchPerspective` returns early when its target is
// already the active perspective, and `ShellLayoutRestorer` sets that id from
// persisted state before any Gearbox code runs. So a session that had a product
// open came back with `gearbox.product` active and no product open -- and the
// *next* open asked for the perspective the shell already believed was active,
// got no `onActivate`, and left the Start screen in the centre with the header
// saying `payments-demo`.
//
// The suite could not see it for a second reason worth keeping: `openProduct`
// in the fixture calls `revealView`, which performs the missing step itself.
// These two tests therefore drive the shell the way a person does and assert
// visibility with no reveal anywhere.
