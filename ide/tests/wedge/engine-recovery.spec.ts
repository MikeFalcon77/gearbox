// What a person is offered after the engine stops, and what survives it.
//
// Step 7 (`engine-timeout.spec.ts`) proved the mechanism: a missed deadline ends
// the engine, every later call refuses, `initialize` is the way back, nothing is
// replayed. It deliberately said nothing about the screen. These three claims
// are the screen, and each one is against a state that was measured before it
// was fixed:
//
// * A read that timed out left the panel silent. The diagnostics count did not
//   go stale, it *vanished* -- and a tab with no badge is how this panel says
//   "nothing to report". Generate stayed offered, one click from a refusal.
//   Nothing said the engine was gone.
// * `Retry`, the only button beside the error, was `ProductStore.reload()`: a
//   re-read through the engine that was not there. One press turned a product
//   with a failed resolve into an empty panel -- name, profile switcher,
//   composition and pending-changes line all gone.
// * A write whose answer never came left **no trace at all** on the panel. The
//   file on disk had the change, the composition showed the text from before it,
//   the draft went on offering to make it, and the only report was a toast.
//
// The seam is `scripts/wedging-engine.mjs`, which forwards the request it
// withholds the answer to. That is the whole reason the second scenario is
// reachable: a timeout is not evidence that the operation did not happen, and a
// stub that swallowed the request could only ever produce the case where it
// did not.
