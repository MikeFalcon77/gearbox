// A real deadline, missed, against a session that was working.
//
// **Why this is not in `tests/conformance/`.** It is not a claim about a design
// document; it is the seam the claims about recovery will be driven through, and
// it needs a backend nobody else is using -- see `playwright.wedge.config.ts`.
// What it proves is the mechanism: that the cap comes from the environment and
// fires, that missing it ends the engine process rather than merely abandoning
// the request, that every later call then refuses, that `initialize` is what
// makes them work again, and that nothing re-sends the operation that was
// abandoned. The **person's** way back -- a Reconnect engine action, the stale
// results ceasing to claim they are current -- is the next step, and this is
// what it will be verified against.
//
// Everything asserted here was, until this file existed, reasoning about a
// constant. The 60s cap is the reason: no claim can sit through one, so nothing
// downstream of the timeout had ever been reached by a test. One sentence was
// already wrong when this first ran -- the message naming the missed deadline was
// being overwritten by its own cleanup (`gearbox-engine-process.ts`), which is
// what a reader saw instead of the deadline for as long as the code existed.
