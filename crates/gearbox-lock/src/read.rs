/// TOML comments are ignored by the parser, so the generated header needs no
/// special handling here.
///
/// Verification re-canonicalizes the parsed product before hashing, so a
/// lock whose collections happen to be in a different order than
/// [`write_canonical`](crate::write_canonical) would choose -- but whose
/// *content* is identical -- still verifies. A lock whose content actually
/// changed does not, which is the point:
/// [`LockError::HashMismatch`] is how a hand edit is caught rather than
/// silently taking effect. The two classes of edit canonicalization would
/// *erase* before hashing -- a duplicated entry, and a key no field reads --
/// are refused before the hash is computed, so they cannot ride inside a lock
/// that reports as verified.
///
/// `schema_version` is read off the parsed document before the product is
/// deserialized from it, which is what turns "a future schema added a
/// required field" into a clear [`LockError::UnsupportedSchemaVersion`]
/// instead of a confusing missing-field parse error.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns [`LockError::UnsupportedSchemaVersion`] if the lock declares a
/// version this build does not understand, [`LockError::Parse`] if it is not
/// valid TOML or does not match the resolved-product schema,
/// [`LockError::UnknownField`] if it carries a key no field of that schema
/// reads, [`LockError::DuplicateEntry`] if it lists one entry of a keyed
/// collection twice, [`LockError::Serialize`] if the parsed product cannot be
/// re-rendered to recompute its hash, [`LockError::HashMismatch`] if its
/// content does not match its own recorded hash, or
/// [`LockError::InvalidContent`] if a verified value is one the generator or
