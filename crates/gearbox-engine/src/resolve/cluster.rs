//! Step 7: which backend answers each cluster primitive.
//!
//! The provider table is **projected** from the `with_*_provider` calls in the
//! cluster gear's registry, not declared anywhere, so a provider added in Rust
//! cannot go missing here and one removed cannot linger. Today that table holds
//! three entries, and the shape of what they offer decides most of this step:
//!
//! * `postgres` answers cache and lock, is linearizable for both, is not
//!   process-local, and needs credentials;
//! * `standalone` answers cache only, adds prefix-watch, is process-local, and
//!   needs none;
//! * `redis` answers cache and lock, is not process-local, needs credentials,
//!   and **declares no capability at all** -- it reads its consistency off the
//!   server it connects to, so there is no composition-time fact to project
//!   (GBX0520). It therefore satisfies only a requirement that asks for none,
//!   which is the honest answer rather than a limitation of this step.
//!
//! **None of them registers leader election.** That is not an omission in this code:
//! zero leader-election providers exist in the runtime, so the primitive always
//! resolves to the SDK's compare-and-swap default layered over whatever cache is
//! bound. Reported rather than hidden, because "leader election works" and
//! "leader election is CAS over your cache" are different promises.
//!
//! The most valuable rule here is the last one. A process-local backend in a
//! topology with more than one process is a correctness bug the runtime would
//! start happily and never complain about: `standalone`'s cache lives in one
//! process's memory, so leader election over it elects a leader *per replica*.
