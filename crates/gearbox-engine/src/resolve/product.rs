//! Step 10: assembling the lock, and step 9's graph alongside it.
//!
//! Everything the earlier steps decided is gathered here into the one artifact
//! every generator reads. Ordering is imposed by `gearbox_lock::canonicalize_order`
//! and the hash by `compute_hash`, so "did anything actually change" is a byte
//! comparison rather than a judgement.
//!
//! The explanation graph is built from the finished resolution rather than
//! accumulated as each decision is made. The plan asked for the latter; the
//! information is identical either way, because every decision already records
//! its own provenance -- a gear knows why it is in the closure, a binding knows
//! what was asked for and what downgraded it, a cluster choice knows whether it
//! was named. Threading a mutable graph through six modules would buy nothing
//! those records do not already carry, and would couple every step to a type
//! none of them otherwise needs.
