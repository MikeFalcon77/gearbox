//! A product's config values against the types their gears declare.
//!
//! The join this performs has no resolution in it -- a product's selected gears
//! against the catalogue's projected fields -- which is why it is a pure
//! function with a `Diagnostics` out-parameter rather than a step of the
//! resolver.
//!
//! **It is called from two places, and both are necessary.** `validate` is where
//! a join like this belongs, but the Add Gear panel resolves rather than
//! validates, so a check placed only in `validate` would never appear where a
//! person is actually standing when they set a value. `Diagnostics::finish`
//! sorts and dedups, so a caller that ran both reports each finding once.
//!
//! **Unknown keys are errors.** Generated YAML is deserialized with
//! `deny_unknown_fields`, so a key the projected schema does not name produces
//! a file the runtime refuses at startup. A field the gear reads belongs in
//! the schema; a typo must not reach the file.
