//! Which of a checkout's crates the build can take from a registry.
//!
//! `source(..., at = path("../gears-rust"), crates = registry("crates.io"))`
//! says the gears in a checkout are also published. Descriptions still come from
//! the checkout -- a published crate carries no `gear.gdl` -- but the generated
//! build should name `cf-gears-api-gateway = "=0.5.2"` rather than a path into
//! somebody's working tree, so the output repository builds from the registry
//! alone.
//!
//! **Declared, then checked, crate by crate.** A checkout on a feature branch is
//! usually *not* what was published: the toolkit on the branch this was written
//! against carries a fix for out-of-process workers that no release has yet.
//! Every published package records the commit it was cut from and its path in
//! that repository (`.cargo_vcs_info.json`), so the question "is this crate what
//! was published?" has an exact answer: diff the checkout against that commit,
//! under that path. Three outcomes:
//!
//! * **as published** -- a registry dependency at the exact version;
//! * **changed since** -- still the registry version, plus a `[patch]` entry
//!   pointing at the checkout, so the whole graph links one copy and it is the
//!   code the resolver read (GBX0709);
//! * **not published at this version** -- a path dependency, as before
//!   (GBX0710).
//!
//! If the registry cannot be asked at all, everything stays a path dependency
//! (GBX0711). None of this is guessed from names or from the network being up.
//!
//! **This module reads the world** -- cargo, git, the registry cache -- so it
//! lives at the edge with [`crate::registry`]: the CLI and the RPC server call
//! it, and `generate` receives only its answer, a [`RegistryPlan`].
