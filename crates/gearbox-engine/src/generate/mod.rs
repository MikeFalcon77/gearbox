//! Turning a `product.lock` into files.
//!
//! [`generate`] is a pure function from a [`ResolvedProduct`] to a [`FileSet`]:
//! same lock in, same bytes out, no clock, no environment, no filesystem. That
//! is what makes `--dry-run` trustworthy -- the preview is produced by the same
//! code that produces the artefact, not by a second implementation that
//! describes it.
//!
//! **Two functions here touch the filesystem, and neither is reachable from
//! `generate`.** [`apply`] writes, which is its whole job.
//! [`templates::TemplateSet::load_for_product`] reads a product's template
//! overlay, and it is called by the CLI and the RPC *before* generation, so the
//! overlay arrives as data in [`GenerateInput`]. Reading it inside would mean a
//! `--dry-run` answering about a tree it had gone and looked at, which is the
//! one thing the preview must not do.
//!
//! **Why this lives in `gearbox-engine` and not in a `gearbox-gen` crate.** The
//! plan names a separate crate. Two things argue against it here, and the second
//! is decisive. First, precedent: this repository has twice folded a planned
//! crate into an existing one when the boundary bought nothing -- `gearbox-verify`
//! became `gearbox-project`, `gearbox-resolve` became `gearbox-engine::resolve`.
//! Second, [`apply`] must live in `gearbox-engine` regardless, because that is
//! the crate permitted to touch the filesystem; a separate crate would therefore
//! split the writer from the thing it writes, and every generator would be one
//! `use` away from a caller that forgot which half it was holding. Purity is a
//! property of these functions, and it is asserted by testing them from literals
//! rather than by a manifest that cannot see inside them.
//!
//! **What is here and what is not.** Every process in the lock is generated,
//! host or worker. Dockerfiles and a Helm chart are emitted for a Kubernetes
//! profile. There used to be a `skipped` list
//! naming the workers this could not produce, on the argument that a generator
//! emitting four files out of six and saying nothing is indistinguishable from
//! a finished one. That argument was right and the list is gone anyway: the
//! dispatch on [`ProcessKind`] is exhaustive, so a kind this cannot generate is
//! now a compile error at the `match` rather than a value at run time. The list
//! should come back the moment something can genuinely be skipped, with a
//! producer -- an always-empty field is a report nobody can ever read.
