//! The only writer.
//!
//! Two functions, and the split between them is the whole safety story.
//! [`plan`] reads the output tree and reports what applying would do; it writes
//! nothing, which is what makes `--dry-run` and `gearbox/generate/plan` a
//! preview of the real thing rather than a description of it
//! (`cpt-gearbox-fr-generate-preview`). [`apply_generate`] performs that plan.
//!
//! **The apply is staged.** Every file is prepared in memory -- including the
//! three-way merges, which are where a failure is actually likely -- and
//! nothing is written until every one of them has succeeded. ADR
//! `cpt-gearbox-adr-authoring-ownership-tiers` requires this, and the reason it
//! requires it is that the alternative leaves a tree that is half of one product
//! and half of another, which nothing downstream can detect.
//!
//! **The merge base.** An `OperatorOwned` file is reconciled against the copy of
//! *our previous output* cached in `.gearbox/<product>/.base/`, not against the
//! operator's file and not against nothing. That is what lets the merge tell
//! "the operator changed this line" from "we changed this line": without a base,
//! any difference looks like both.
