//! What is wrong with one description, given the text rather than the file.
//!
//! The language server's whole engine-side surface. One function rather than
//! two because the rule deciding which evaluator runs is the file's *name*, and
//! that rule is already written down twice -- `PRODUCT_FILE` and `GEAR_FILE`.
//! A caller applying it itself would be a third place for the two names to live,
//! and the editor's language registration would be a fourth.
//!
//! Reads nothing. The text belongs to the client's buffer, which is the point:
//! what is on disk is the question `load_product` and `load_catalogue` answer,
//! and an editor asking about a file it has not saved must not be told about
//! the version it is replacing.

/// `source_root` is the gear source root this file was found in, when it was
/// found in one. **It is deliberately ignored for a product**, which is never
/// inside a source root: `load_product` passes `None` at every call site, so a
/// product handed a wider `load()` boundary than the real loader gives it could
/// come back clean here and fail when it is loaded from disk. Answering the same
/// question two ways depending on who asked is the one thing this must not do.

/// description and nothing else. `gearbox/validate` answers a superficially
/// similar question by rescanning the whole corpus, which is right for a button
/// and wrong here by three orders of magnitude.
