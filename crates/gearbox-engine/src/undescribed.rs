//! Finding a gear that exists in Rust but has no `gear.gdl` (GBX0208).
//!
//! Only ever called on the error path -- a product selected a gear the catalogue
//! does not have -- and that is what makes the cost acceptable. It is also what
//! makes the diagnostic worth the code: the tree holds 44 `#[toolkit::gear]`
//! attributes and 14 descriptions, so "not in the catalogue" is far more often
//! "nobody has described it yet" than "you misspelled it". Those two need
//! different answers, and only this search can tell them apart.
//!
//! The search is textual before it is syntactic. A crate is a candidate only if
//! some file under its `src/` literally contains the quoted gear name, which
//! rules out almost the whole tree without parsing it; then that crate is
//! scanned properly, because a name inside a comment or a string is not a gear.
