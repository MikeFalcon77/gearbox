//! Merging a gear's declared configuration curation with its projected fields.
//!
//! The two halves are deliberately unequal. Rust states what the fields *are* --
//! name, type, whether required, what they default to -- and ADR
//! `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue` gives Rust every fact Rust
//! already expresses. The description contributes the one judgement Rust has no
//! way to hold: which of those fields is worth putting in front of an
//! integrator, and in what order. `ApiGatewayConfig` declares fourteen fields
//! and the configuration files in the tree set five.
//!
//! **`exposes` is checked, not trusted.** It names Rust facts, so it can drift
//! from them, and a list that silently stopped matching would show controls for
//! keys the gear no longer reads. Naming a field the struct does not declare is
//! `GBX0212`. That check is the whole reason a curated list is not a second copy
//! of the struct.
