//! The worked examples in the GDL reference are executed, not just printed.
//!
//! They had rotted, and the way they rotted is the argument for this file. The
//! product example declared `provider("postgres", …)` with no `secret_ref` --
//! which the same document calls `GBX0506` one page earlier -- and left
//! `use_gear("cluster", …)` out of a product declaring cluster profiles, which
//! makes every cluster requirement `GBX0505`. Anyone who copied it got errors
//! from the reference that was supposed to teach them the language.
//!
//! Nothing had ever run them. A language reference is the one document whose
//! examples can be checked mechanically, so leaving them unchecked was a choice
//! nobody made deliberately.
//!
//! **Extracted, not copied.** The examples are read out of `docs/gdl.md` at test
//! time. A copy pasted into this file would pass forever while the document
//! drifted, which is the failure being fixed rather than a different one.
//!
//! **The reference is in this repository**, beside the interpreter it describes.
//! It spent a while in the corpus checkout, and reading it was gated on that
//! checkout being present; it is tracked here now, so that gate is gone along
//! with the three-way decision that expressed it.
//!
//! The two examples claim different things and are checked differently. The gear
//! example names a crate that does not exist on disk, so it is *evaluated* --
//! syntax, refused arguments, records -- and no more. The product example is
//! evaluated and then **resolved against the real corpus**, which is what makes
//! `GBX0505` and `GBX0506` observable at all, and is the only part of this file
//! that still wants `gears-rust` on disk.
