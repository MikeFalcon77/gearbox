//! `gearbox/product/resolvePreview` answers about a description that is not on
//! disk, and leaves the one that is exactly as it found it.
//!
//! The point of the method is that a person can see what adding a gear does
//! *before* deciding to do it. That is only true if asking is free -- a preview
//! that wrote would make the question indistinguishable from the answer, and the
//! Add Gear panel asks on a debounce, so it would write while someone types.
//!
//! Byte-for-byte, not "unchanged apart from formatting": the edit pipeline is a
//! text transform, and a preview that reformatted a file would be a write.
