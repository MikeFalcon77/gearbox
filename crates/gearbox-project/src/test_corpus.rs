//! Finding the real gear tree, for the tests that project from it.
//!
//! Every locator here used to spell the corpus as
//! `$CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/../../../gears-rust`, which is the sibling of the
//! *repository* root. From a git worktree -- `.claude/worktrees/<name>/crates/…`
//! -- that resolves to nothing, so every test that projects from real gears
//! skipped, printed a reason nobody reads, and the suite reported success having
//! exercised none of the corpus. An agent working in a worktree got that
//! silently, which is the whole problem: the skip was designed for a checkout
//! without the sibling repository, and it quietly covered a second case it was
//! never meant to.
//!
//! Walking up finds the corpus from either layout, and stops at the filesystem
//! root rather than guessing a depth.
