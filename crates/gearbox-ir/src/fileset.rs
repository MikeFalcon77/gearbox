//! What a generator produces, and who owns each byte of it.
//!
//! Every generator returns a [`FileSet`]: a sorted list of [`FileEntry`], each
//! carrying its own [`Ownership`]. Nothing here writes anything --
//! `gearbox_engine::generate::apply` is the only writer, and it decides what to
//! do with a file by reading the class recorded here rather than by inspecting
//! the path. That split is deliberate. A writer that guessed ownership from a
//! filename would be one rename away from overwriting an operator's edits, and
//! the guess would live in a different crate from the decision it implements.
//!
//! The three classes come from ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-authoring-ownership-tiers`,
//! which states them as a rule rather than a list: the tool may freely write
//! what it solely owns, may write once into a place the human has not yet
//! occupied, and may never rewrite human-authored content without a fallback.
//! [`Ownership`] is that rule made into a type, so a new generator has to pick a
//! side rather than inherit one.
