//! Generates the vocabulary the editor's `.gdl` grammar colours.
//!
//! The grammar itself is hand-written TypeScript
//! (`ide/gearbox-studio/src/browser/gdl/gdl-grammar.ts`) because its hard part
//! is regex craft, which does not change when someone adds a GDL function. Its
//! *volatile* part is six word lists, and those are generated here from the
//! very globals the interpreter evaluates against -- so the editor cannot
//! colour a function the engine does not have, nor miss one it does.
//!
//! Run by `cargo test --package gearbox-gdl --test export_grammar`, which is
//! what `make grammar` invokes. Anti-drift is enforced in the build, not by
//! habit: after regenerating, `git diff --exit-code` over the output directory
//! must be empty (`cpt-gearbox-nfr-no-type-drift`, applied to the editor's view
//! of the language rather than to the wire).
//!
//! Deliberately not emitted:
//!
//! * `KNOWN_CATEGORIES` -- it occurs only inside string literals, and it drives
//!   a *warning* about a taxonomy `vocabulary.rs` itself calls "visibly still
//!   settling". A warning is the wrong thing to paint.
//! * The `gear()` parameters refused as restatement (`id`, `runtime_caps`, ...)
//!   -- they are illegal only *inside* `gear(...)`, which a `TextMate` grammar
//!   cannot scope without a `begin`/`end` whose `end` would trip on the first
//!   nested `)`.
//!   Meanwhile `id = "payments-demo"` is legal in a `product.gdl`, so a global
//!   rule would paint false alarms in the one product file we ship. GBX0210
//!   already names the owning attribute, which is more useful than red.
